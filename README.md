# MoviePitch

# MoviePitch is a web application that generates creative responses to movie outlines using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 language model. It's a fun project that showcases the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and how it can generate engaging content based on input prompts.

## Features

- **Creative Movie Outline Responses:** # MoviePitch takes a movie outline as input and generates enthusiastic and creative responses to it. The responses mimic the tone of a movie executive giving feedback.

- **Real-time Interaction:** Users can enter their movie outline in a text input field, and the AI's response is dynamically displayed on the page without requiring a page refresh.

- **Visual Loading Feedback:** A loading animation is displayed while the AI processes the input and generates a response, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
